# Implementing-a-Perceptron-
 Implementing a perceptron is a straightforward process, as it is one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks.
#Steps to Implement a Perceptron
1. Initialize Parameters: Set up the weights and bias for the perceptron.
2. Forward Pass: Calculate the weighted sum and apply an activation function (often a step function).
3. Training: Update weights and bias using the perceptron learning rule.
4. Iterate: Repeat for a fixed number of epochs or until convergence.
